 - filtervariants now supports filtering on .variant_list with lines
   of the form contig:pos:ref:alt1,alt2,...altN.

 - `isNotMissing` renamed to `isDefined`.  `isMissing` and
   `isDefined` are now single-argument functions and can be used
   with structs, e.g., `isMissing(x)` instead of `x.isMissing`.

 - Fixed precedence bug in parser.  You can now write `!g.isHet`
   instead of `!(g.isNet)`.

 - count: `nLocalSamples` is gone.  `nSamples` reports the number of
   samples currently in the dataset.
